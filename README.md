**Student Performance Analysis Dashboard**

**Project Overview**

A data-driven project called the Student Achievement Analysis Dashboard was created to assess students' academic achievement using a variety of contributing factors. This dashboard offers information on the effects of parental education level, gender, race/ethnicity, and other socioeconomic characteristics on overall student success through interactive visualizations.Teachers, legislators, and academics can use this initiative to pinpoint areas where student achievement gaps exist and create focused reform plans.

**Objectives**

Use the combined scores to examine the overall performance of the students.
To identify patterns and discrepancies, compare performance by gender and race/ethnicity.
Analyze how parental educational attainment affects students' achievement.
To draw attention to areas that need intervention, identify performance gaps.

**Key Features & Visualizations**

**1. Overall Performance Score**

shows the average student achievement across all topics as a single metric (203.31).
aids in evaluating students' overall academic standing.

**2. Gender-Based Performance Distribution**

a pie chart that shows the percentage of male and female pupils.
enables gender-based comparisons of academic performance.
draws attention to possible performance disparities based on gender.

**3. Gender Distribution by Race/Ethnicity**

Students are categorized by gender and race/ethnicity in a bar chart.
makes it possible to use demographic research to comprehend performance trends and diversity.

**4. Performance Gap vs. Overall Performance**

A donut chart that shows how student performance differs from expectations.
finds groups of students that are performing poorly and require more help.

**5. Influence of Parental Education on Performance**

Bar chart: Shows the total performance ratings for various parental education levels compared to the performance disparities.
A line graph that clearly illustrates how student performance declines when parental education levels fall.

**Findings:**

Students do noticeably better when their parents have a bachelor's or master's degree.
People who have parents with only a high school diploma or a college degree typically perform worse.

**Key Insights & Findings**

Student performance and parental education are highly correlated; better academic results are associated with higher levels of education.
Although they may differ among various racial and ethnic groups, gender differences do exist.
Performance differences draw attention to educational disparities and point to the necessity of more support systems for populations that do poorly.
Students from lower-education homes can benefit from early interventions and support programs.
